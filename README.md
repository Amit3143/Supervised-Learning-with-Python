 Supervised Learning – Decision Tree (Python)

 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Decision Tree algorithm**, a popular **Supervised Learning** technique, using **Python and Scikit-Learn**.

The goal of this project is to help beginners and college students understand how Decision Trees work for **classification problems** through a simple and practical example.

 Objectives
- Understand supervised learning concepts
- Implement Decision Tree classification
- Train and test a machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance
- Apply decision trees to real-world–like data

---

 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **Scikit-Learn** – Decision Tree algorithm
- **NumPy** – numerical operations

---

 Dataset Description
The dataset is a simple labeled dataset representing:
- **Hours Studied** → Input feature
- **Pass / Fail** → Output label

| Hours Studied | Pass |
|-------------|------|
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 |
| 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 |

This makes it a **supervised learning problem**.

 Methodology
1. Import required Python libraries
2. Create or load labeled dataset
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train Decision Tree classifier
5. Make predictions on test data
6. Evaluate model accuracy

 Algorithm Used
### Decision Tree Classifier
- Uses **if–else rules** for decision-making
- Splits data based on feature values
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Works well for classification problems

 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
