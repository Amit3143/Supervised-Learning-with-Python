# 🌳 Supervised Learning – Decision Tree (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Decision Tree algorithm**, a popular **Supervised Learning** technique, using **Python and Scikit-Learn**.

The goal of this project is to help beginners and college students understand how Decision Trees work for **classification problems** through a simple and practical example.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand supervised learning concepts
- Implement Decision Tree classification
- Train and test a machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance
- Apply decision trees to real-world–like data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **Scikit-Learn** – Decision Tree algorithm
- **NumPy** – numerical operations

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset is a simple labeled dataset representing:
- **Hours Studied** → Input feature
- **Pass / Fail** → Output label

| Hours Studied | Pass |
|-------------|------|
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 |
| 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 |

This makes it a **supervised learning problem**.
